# TASKR

By Amrita Raja

## What is it?
Calendar application that lets you save events for each hours of the day 9am-5pm. 

## What's updated?
-Modified the starter code to display the current day at the top of the calendar.
-Added time blocks in the html that displays a corresponding color depending on the time of day (past, present, future).
-Created a save button that saves an event to the local storage. 

BONUS
- Created a clear button to easily clear the local storage that will reset tasks. This is much easier than erasing one block at a time and saving each them indivdually.


## Why is this useful?
This is a great way to challenge your knowledge on Javascript methods and functions.
